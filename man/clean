cmd: clean, v1.0.0
status: linux(stable), android(stable), windows(experinmental), mac(experinmental)

DESCRIPTION
     similar to the rkill command but only removes ghost services.
     the main difference between the rkill and clean command is that rkill command kills all services
     including ghosts and none-ghost services while the clean command only removes ghost services.
     use the clean command in cases where you want to ensure your machine is not bloated with useless data's
     of ghost services.

KEYWORDS 
     ghosts/ghost-services : read the cmd `kill` manual to learn more.
     none-ghost services: services that are currently active and running.
     || : referes to or 
     <no-option> : you dont have to specify any option

USAGE
    `gce clean <option || no-option>`

OPTIONS 
     --nosleep                
        notifies gce to keep the process running and iteratively remove ghost services 
        at a certain interval (3 minutes).    

NOTE
    clean would return nothing if there are no GHOST services to remove.

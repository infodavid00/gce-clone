Command: clean, v1.0.0
Status:
     Android (stable), 
     Linux (stable),
     Windows (experimental), 
     macOS (experimental)

DESCRIPTION
     Similar to the rkill command but only removes ghost services.
     The main difference between the rkill and clean commands is that the rkill command kills all services
     including both ghosts and non-ghosts, whereas the clean command only removes ghost services.
     Use the clean command in cases where you want to ensure your machine is not bloated with useless data
     produced by ghost services.

KEYWORDS 
     ghosts/ghost services : Read the cmd `kill` manual to learn more.
     non-ghost services: Services that are active and running.
     || : Same as "or".
     no-option : Which means specifying an option is not mandatory.

USAGE
    `gce clean [option || no-option]`

OPTIONS 
     --nosleep                
        Notifies gce to keep the process running and iteratively remove ghost services 
        at a regular interval (every 3 minutes).    

EXAMPLES 
    `gce clean`
    `gce clean --nosleep`

NOTE
    The clean command would return nothing if there are no ghost services to remove.

DESCRIPTION
    packages are add-ins created by users that provides additional support to gce services
    rather than just the regular built in fs i/o operations.
    they provide various kind of functionalities: http clients (simlar to vscode REST client),
    live server, word finders, custom service api and lot more.
    the gce `pkg` command provides sub commands that allows adding, removing,
    updating, listing and documenting packages etc.

LIMITATIONS
    unlike other code editors/environments like vscode, packages does not provide
    a user interface for interating with a service instead there communicate using
    custom stateless protocols. similar to apis.

UNIQUE_FEATURES
  -  since the gce package acts as an add-in api, it can be written in any 
     of your prefered language: node, python, ruby, java, platform specific executables (bin) in c, c++, rust, go, nim
     etc as long as it runs properly in the environment and the machine has the neccessary requirements (eg: interpreted languages for packages that aren't native binaries),
     you are good to go.
  -  a mirror or custom repository that stores meta data about packages and can be
     easily accessed, cached, and modified etc.

COMMAND install, v1.0.0

DESCRIPTION
    this commnad provides functionalities for installing a gcce.
    if your'e not familiar with the term `gcce`, gce recommends running `gce
    man about` to understand what a gcce is all about.


UNIQUE_FEATURES
    when you install a gcce, gce does not copy the code base of the gcce to an 
    isolated folder or similar, gce only reads the `gconfig.json` file located in
    the root directory of every gcce codebase, and copies its contents to its own 
    config file.
    this approach is to give gcce developers a more convient way to test gcces
    on developement.
    gce recommends users to store the codebase of all installed gcces in a dedicated
    file path for example <home>/gce/gcce/ so as to maintain readability and prevent
    tampering of the code since changes made to the gcce codebase would reflect in
    every service on start, restart or reload.

USAGE
    `gce install <relative/path/to/gcce>`
    where '<relative/path/to/gcce>' should be the actual relative path to the gcce.
    if written successfully, the gcce is added to gce's config file and the gcce
    can now be used in any gce service. congrats!

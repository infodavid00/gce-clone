DESCRIPTION
    This command is used to install a gcce. Gcce's have a unique method of installation. 
    In order to install a gcce, you need to download its bundled code from its official 
    website. If you're not familiar with the term gcce, gce recommends returning to the 
    gce home page to read about it.

UNIQUE FEATURES
    When you install a gcce, gce does not copy the actual code of the gcce to an 
    isolated folder or similar. Instead, gce reads the gconfig.json file located in 
    the root directory of every gcce codebase, and copies its contents to its own 
    config file/registry. This approach provides gcce developers a more convenient way 
    to test gcce's during development. Gce recommends users store the codebase of all 
    installed gcce's in a dedicated file path, such as <home>/gce/gcce/, to maintain 
    readability and prevent tampering with the code. Changes made to the gcce codebase 
    will reflect in every service on start, restart, or reload.

USAGE
    gce install <relative/path/to/gcce>
    where <relative/path/to/gcce> is the relative path to the gcce. If executed 
    successfully, the gcce is added to gce's config file/registry, which means the 
    gcce can now be used in any gce service. Congratulations!

DESCRIPTION
    this commnad provides features for installing a gcce.
    if youre not familiar with the term `gcce`, gce recommends running `gce
    man about` to understand what a gcce is all about.


UNIQUE_FEATURES
    when you install a gcce, gce does not copy the actual code of the gcce to an 
    isolated folder or similar, instead gce reads the `gconfig.json` file located in
    the root directory of every gcce codebase, and copies its contents to its own 
    config file/ registry.
    this approach provides gcce developers a more convient way to test gcces
    on developement.
    gce recommends users to store the codebase of all installed gcces in a dedicated
    file path for example <home>/gce/gcce/ so as to maintain readability and prevent
    tampering of the code since changes made to the gcce codebase would reflect in
    every service on start, restart or reload.

USAGE
    `gce install <relative/path/to/gcce>`
    where '<relative/path/to/gcce>' is the relative path to the gcce.
    if executed successfully, the gcce is added to gce's config file/registry which means the gcce
    can now be used in any gce service. congrats!

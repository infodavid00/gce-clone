COMMAND start, v1.0.0
status: linux(stable), android(stable), windows(experinmental), mac(experinmental)

DESCRIPTION
    the start command is gce's main command for starting a service. this command 
    is an invinsible command which means you dont have to specify the `start` command
    you only need the part to the service and thats all.

USAGE 
    gce <relative_path_to_file/dir> [--options or no-option ]

SPECIAL_NOTE
    if gce cannot find the relative_path_to_the_dir specified, it would 
    create the path iteratively as a directory and not a file

CONFIGURATIONS
    in cases where you want to use a specific gcce for a specific service,
    without setting a global config, you would have to create a gceconfig.json
    in the root of the directory.
    where gceconfig.json is a json object that can contains the following:
    {
       "default": "<gcce_name>"
    }
    identically to the global config, infact it is just like the global config
    but is usually refered to as the local config as the configurations are only
    specific to a single service.
    Note that the local config has no effect on temporary services or services
    that points to a file. gce would always use the global config in this cases.

OPTIONS
    --temp 
        Marks the service as `temporary`, which means once the service dies, 
        all data's related to it are wiped out. this services are useful in cases where you
        are writing tests/prototypes that neccessarily dont need to be saved.
        Note that temporary services can only be directories.

        In temporary services, the <relativepath/to/service/fs> argument is threated as the 
        name of the temporary service so gce recommendeds using a single name and not
        a path as:
        
        whenever you run `gce <relativepath/to/service/fs> --temp` unlike normal services
        where gce would create <relativepath/to/service/fs> if not found, when the --temp option
        is specified, gce would merge the relative/path/to/service/fs to a simple
        temporary directory name possibly omiting the forward slash(/) and colon(:)
        symbols.
        in this case, gce might even create the temporary service | directory name as
        relativepathtoservicefs if you specified path: relativepath/to/service/fs.
        Its generally recommended to use a meaningful single name (without white-spaces) as a temporary service and not a path-like name or path.

    --port:<Port_Number>  
        by default gce would pick a random registered port (1024 - 49150) where 
        the service would listen to. by specifying this option, gce would use the
        specified port to run your service. 
        in the usage described above replace <Port_Number> with the actual port 
        number.
        Note that ports can only be registered (1024 - 49150).
        example `gce <relative/path/to/fs> --port:8080`
    
     --FAIAF
        notifies gce to threat the command as a start command.
        in cases where you have a directory or file named `install` for example, if
        you where to run `gce install` it would call the install command instead
        of starting the service: ./install
        the --FAIAF notifies gce that the command is to start a service and nothing else.

    macOS (experimental)

DESCRIPTION
    The start command is GCE's main command for starting a service. This command is a 
    hidden command, which means you don't have to specify the start command 
    explicitly; you only need to provide the path to the service.

USAGE
    gce <relative_path_to_file/dir> [--options || no-option]

SPECIAL NOTE
    If gce cannot find the specified relative_path_to_dir, it will create the path 
    iteratively as a directory and not as a file.

CONFIGURATIONS
    In cases where you want to use a specific gcce for a specific service without 
    setting a global config, you would need to create a gceconfig.json file in the root of 
    the directory. The gceconfig.json file is a JSON object that contains the 
    following:
    {
       "default": "<gcce_name>"
    }
    This is similar to the global config but is referred to as the local config 
    because the configurations are specific to a single service. Note that the local 
    config has no effect on temporary services or services that points to a file. 
    Gce will always use the global config in these cases.

OPTIONS
   --temp
      Marks the service as temporary, which means once the service dies, all related 
      data are wiped out. These services are useful for tests/prototypes that don't 
      need to be saved. Note that temporary services can only be directories.

      In temporary services, the <relative_path/to/service/fs> argument is treated as 
      the name of the temporary service. Gce recommends using a single name and not a 
      path. When you run `gce <relative_path/to/service/fs> --temp`, gce will merge 
      `relative/path/to/service/fs` into a simple temporary directory name, 
      possibly omitting the forward slash (/) and colon (:) symbols. For example, 
      gce might create the temporary service directory as `relativepathtoservicefs` if 
      you specified the path `relative/path/to/service/fs`. It is generally recommended 
      to use a meaningful single name (without white spaces) as a temporary service 
      name, rather than a path-like name or path.
      Example   `gce serviceName --temp`

   --port:<Port_Number>
      By default, GCE will pick a random registered port (1024 - 49150) on Windows, Linux
      and Mac, and (1024 - 65535) for Android for the service
      to listen to. By specifying this option, GCE will use the specified port to run 
      your service. Replace <Port_Number> with the actual port number. Note that only 
      registered ports (1024 - 49150) can be used.
      Example: `gce <path_to_fs> --port:8080`

   --FAIAF
      Notifies gce to treat the command as a start command. In cases where you have a 
      directory, file or temporary service named install, running `gce install` would 
      call the install command instead of starting the service `install`. 
      The --FAIAF option ensures gce starts the service instead of executing another
      command.

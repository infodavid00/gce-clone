DESCRIPTION
    This command provides features for removing an existing gcce.

USAGE
    gce remove <gcce_name>
    where '<gcce_name>' is the name of a valid gcce currently installed.
    In cases where multiple versions of the gcce are installed, gce would be unable to 
    determine which to keep and which to remove. In that case, you will get a prompt 
    to specify the version of the gcce you want to remove.
    If executed successfully, the process is closed without a response.
    Note: If you are prompted to input a version and none of the gce's matches that 
    version, you will not get an error, but instead, it will behave similarly to a 
    successful removal. To confirm the gcce removal, run `gce gcce`.

DESCRIPTION
    this command provides features for removing an existing gcce.

USAGE
    `gce remove <gcce_name>`
    where '<gcce_name>' is the name of a valid gcce currently installed.
    in cases where multiple versions of the gcce are installed, gce would
    be unable to determine which to keep and which to remove in that case, you 
    would get a prompt to specify the version of the gcce you want to remove.
    if executed successfully, the process is closed without a response.
    note: if you were prompted to input a version and none of the gcces where that 
    version, you would not get an error, but instead same behaviour similar
    to if the gcce was successfully removed.
    in other to confirm the gcce removal, run `gce gcce`

DESCRIPTION
    gce's recommended way of killing a running gce service gracefully.

KEYWORDS
    ghost services: Services that are in the service log/registry but are not currently
    running due to abortion (e.g., using Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, shutdown, reboot, etc).
    || : Same as "or".
    <no-option> : Which means specifying an option is not mandatory.

USAGE
    gce kill <serviceId> || <no-argument>

NOTE
    You will get 'kill ESRCH: ghost removed' if you try to kill a ghost service.
    Note that the service is still removed from the registry, and all data tied to it 
    are erased from the disk as well.
    You will get nothing in return if the service was alive and successfully killed.

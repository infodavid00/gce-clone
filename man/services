  in the log/registry, and return the total number of services in the registry: ghosts inclusive
  together with the lists of services currently running (ghosts exclusive).

     about each (ghosts exclusive).

     List more extensive information about a specific service <serviceId>
     Note that gce would only return these information if the service is currently
     running and not a ghost.

DESCRIPTION
    this command provides features for creating a global configuration for your
    gcce services.
    global configurations are usefull when you want to ensure all services feels
    the same. currently the global config only recognizes 1 field which is the
    `default` field. the default field sets a default gcce to use on start of every
    service, this can be usefull in cases where multiple gcces are installed.
    when running a service, if gce cannot find a global configuation with the
    `default` field or a local configuration which is usually a file named 
    `gceconfig.json` in the root directory of the service path, 
    the user would be prompted to choose a gcce before starting the service.
    NOTE: when running a service, if the default gcce in either configs (local or global)
    has multiple versions installed, gce would choose the first one it finds which
    is usually the last installed.

SPECIAL_NOTE
    gce uses the global config always if the service is a temporary service or 
    the service path points to a file.

USAGE
    `gce globalConfig`

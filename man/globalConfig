DESCRIPTION
    This command provides an interface that allows users to create a global 
    configuration for their gce services.

    Global configurations are useful in cases where you want to ensure that all 
    services act the same way. Currently, gce only recognizes one configuration, which 
    is the default configuration. The default configuration specifies a default gcce 
    to use on the start of every service. This can be useful in cases where multiple 
    gce's are installed. When running a service, if gce cannot find a default 
    configuration in the global configuration file or in the local configuration file, 
    which is usually a file named gceconfig.json in the root directory of the actual 
    service, the user will be prompted to choose a gcce before starting the service.
    NOTE: If the default gcce in either configuration (local or global) has multiple 
    versions installed, gce will choose the first version of the gcce it finds in the 
    registry, which is usually the last version of the gcce installed.

SPECIAL NOTE
    gce uses the global configuration always if the service is a temporary service or 
    the service path points to a file.

USAGE
    `gce globalConfig`

EXAMPLES
    gceconfig.json file sample :
    {
      "default" : "<name_of_gcce>"
    }

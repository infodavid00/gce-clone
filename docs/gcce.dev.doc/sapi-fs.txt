-- SAPI TYPE = FS
-- OPERATION TYPES =

  READDIR => 
    the readdir operation allows clients to read the direct contents/children of a 
    directory relative to the service path.
    @request => {
        "TYPE": "FS",
        "OPERA": "READDIR",
        "OID": "<REQEUSTID>",
        "PAYLOAD": "relative/path/to/servicepath"
      }
    @return => if the request was acknowledged, you should get a response
      with signal `ACK/HASPAYLOAD` where the payload is an array containing the
      dir direct children.
    @payloadFormat => {
        PAYLOAD: [
         { name: "<name>", type: "DIR", size: 0 }, 
         { name: "<name>", type: "FILE", size: 4551 },
         ...etc
        ]
     }
     NOTE: size would always be 0 on type dir.
     
  
  STATICS => 
    the statics operation allows clients to retrieve information about a file or
    directoy relative to the service path.
    @request => {
        "TYPE": "FS",
        "OPERA": "STATICS",
        "OID": "<REQEUSTID>",
        "PAYLOAD": "relative/path/to/servicepath"
      }
    @return => if the request was acknowledged, you should get a response
      with signal `ACK/HASPAYLOAD` where the payload is an object containing the
      the information of the file or directory.
    @payloadFormat => {
        PAYLOAD: {
         path: "absolute/path/to/the/requests/relative-path",
         size: <0 for dir  || size for file>,
         created: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MSSZ",

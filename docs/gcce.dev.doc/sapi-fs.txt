This file contains documentation for working with crud operations on the pc's 
file system using gce's service api.

-- SAPI TYPE = FS
-- OPERATION TYPES =

  READDIR => 
    the readdir operation allows clients to read the direct contents/children of a 
    directory relative to the service path.
    @request => {
        "TYPE": "FS",
        "OPERA": "READDIR",
        "OID": "<REQEUSTID>",
        "PAYLOAD": "relative/path/to/servicepath"
      }
    @return => if the request was acknowledged, you should get a response
      with signal `ACK/HASPAYLOAD` where the payload is an array containing the
      dir direct children.
    @payloadFormat => {
        PAYLOAD: [
         { name: "<name>", type: "DIR", size: 0 }, 
         { name: "<name>", type: "FILE", size: 4551 <in bytes> },
         ...etc
        ]
     }
     NOTE: size would always be 0 on type dir.
===================================================================================
     
  
  STATICS => 
    the statics operation allows clients to retrieve information about a file or
    directoy relative to the service path.
    @request => {
        "TYPE": "FS",
        "OPERA": "STATICS",
        "OID": "<REQEUSTID>",
        "PAYLOAD": "relative/path/to/servicepath"
      }
    @return => if the request was acknowledged, you should get a response
      with signal `ACK/HASPAYLOAD` where the payload is an object containing the
      the information of the file or directory.
    @payloadFormat => {
        PAYLOAD: {
         path: "absolute/path/to/the/requests/relative-path",
         size: <0 for dir  || size of file in bytes>,
         created: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MSSZ",
         lmodified: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MSSZ",
         isDir: <true || false>
        }
     }
====================================================================================


  READFILE => 
    the readfile operation allows clients to read a file relative to the service path.
    the readfile provides two techniques for file reading : 
    1: reads and return the entire contents of the file (default).
    2: reads the contents of the file batch by batch by calculating the total number
       of lines that are visible in the UI window and return only portion or more if
       specified.
       in this technique you would manually make requests to load the next sections
       of the file.
    NOTE: if the contents of the file is less than a megabyte, gce would use the 
    default technique regardless of wether it was enabled or not.
    @request => {
        "TYPE": "FS",
        "OPERA": "READFILE",
        "OID": "<REQEUSTID>",
        "PAYLOAD":  {
          "path" : "relative/path/to/file",
          "useDefault" : <true || false>,
        }
      }
     NOTE: `useDefault : false` tells gce to use the 2nd technique instead. 
     you must specify the following fields in other for the second technique to work:
     window : the windows height in px <default is 800>,
     lineHeight: your gcce text lineHeight in px <default is 17>,
     page: the page size. eg if you set the value to 2, then number of 
        lines of text that are visible on the window * 2 is whats returned (pagination).
        NOTE specifying 0 would cause the operation to return nothing as 0 means page
        0 while the pages index starts from 1 in gce.  <default is 1>.
        if you specify more pages than there is, gce would return everything.
     startLine: the line at which the rendering should start from. if the startLine 
        exceeds the number of lines then nothing is returned. you can use this to
        indicate you have read the entire file completely.
        <defult is 0> which starts from the first line of the file.
     An example of the request payload if default technique is not used is:
        "PAYLOAD":  {
          "path" : "relative/path/to/file",
          "useDefault" : false,
          "window" : 700,
          "lineHeight": 26,
          "page": 2, //always use same value throughout
          "startLine": 0,
        }  
      Next batch request can then goes like this :
        "PAYLOAD":  {
          "path" : "relative/path/to/file",
          "useDefault" : false,
          "window" : 700,
          "lineHeight": 26,
          "page": 2, //always use same value throughout
          "startLine": <request 1 number of lines + 1>,
        }  

    @return => if the request was acknowledged, you should get a response
      with signal `ACK/HASPAYLOAD` where the payload is an object containing the
      following:
    @payloadFormat => {
       PAYLOAD: {
        size: <size in bytes>,
        lmodified: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MSSZ',
        data: <contents of the file>,
        usedDefault:
           <boolean indicating wether the opera used the default technique or not>
       }
     }

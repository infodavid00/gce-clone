This file contains documentation for working with both service and third party
packages using gce's service api.

GCE RECOMMENDS DEVELOPERS TO PLAY WITH THE OPERATIONS PROVIDED IN THIS FILE
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK BEFORE MAKING YOUR OWN GCCE SERVICE TERMINAL.

-- SAPI TYPE = PKG
-- OPERATION TYPES =

   ADD => adds x numbers together where, x means `as many numbers provided.`
   payload => [...numbers]
   the payload should be an array containing the numbers to be added up.

   SUB => subtracts x numbers, starting from payload[0]
   payload => [...numbers]
   the payload should be an array containing the numbers to be subtracted
   by each other in a sequential order eg :
   payload [ 20, 1, 33 ] = 20 - 1,  value - 33.

   DIV => divides payload[0] by payload[1]
   payload => [ operand1, operand2 ]

   MULTIPLY => multiply payload[0] by payload[1]
   payload => [ operand1, operand2 ]

   MOD => divides payload[0] by payload[1] and returns its remainder (Modulo)
   payload => [ operand1, operand2 ]

   POW => returns the value of payload[0] ^ payload[1]
   payload => [ operand1, operand2 ]

   NOTE : THE ADD, SUB, DIV, MULTIPLY, MOD, POW are ligthweigth utilities/packages 
   for basic mathematics. thier purpose is to eleminate the need of rapid 
   switching from code editor to calculator or google search for maths expresssions.

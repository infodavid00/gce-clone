THE CURRENT AVAILABLE SIGNALS (SIG) FOR V1.0.0

NOTE :
--provides a payload-- means the payload isnt null and the resource you
requested was acknowledged and embeded to the response payload.
an empty array is still considered as a response having a payload.

--does not provide a payload-- does not mean the payload field wouldnt be 
present in the response, its more like its not needed an can be discarded similar
to discarding a return value in languages like nim.
in gce sapi for example an error migth not contain a payload if the signal has a 
specific meaning eg ENOENTRY. there is no need for a payload in this case as this
signal indicates the requested resource does'nt exists.

This file contains a list of available Service API signals (SIG) for GCE v1.0.0 and 
later.

Keywords:
- "Provide a payload": 
       The payload field in the response object is not null, and your request was 
       acknowledged with a payload field embedded in the response. Note that an empty
       array in the payload field can still be considered a response with a payload.

- "Does not provide a payload": 
       The payload field in the response object may still be present, but it is not 
       needed and can be discarded, similar to discarding a return value in languages 
       like Nim.

Signals:

- ACK/HASPAYLOAD: The operation was successful, and the response has a payload.

- ACK:  The operation was successful, but the response does not provide a payload.

- DUPKEY: 
      The key (e.g., fileName, packageName) already exists in the requested resource. 
      This signal does not provide a payload.

- STDERR: 
      The operation was unsuccessful due to client-side errors. This operation 
      provides a payload, which is the error message.

- ENOENTRY: 
      The requested resource was not found. This signal does not provide a payload.

- OSFORBIDEN: 
      The request was considered forbidden at the OS level (e.g., trying to read a 
      directory but provided a path to a file). This signal does not provide a 
      payload.

- ONLINE: 
      Common in write operations, notifies the client that another service or previous
      request is still working on the specified resource (e.g., a file). This happens 
      when a .gcelock.<nameoffile> file is present in the directory where the file 
      resides, indicating that another/same service is writing to the same file. If a 
      service fails to remove the .gcelock.<nameoffile> file after writing to the 
      target destination, you may need to manually remove it to resolve the issue.

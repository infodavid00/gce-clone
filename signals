THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SIGNALS (SIG) FOR V1.0.0

NOTE :
--does not have a payload-- means the payload isnt null and you are recommended
to extract the value since its must contain a value. an empty array still means the
request has a payload.

--does not have a payload-- means the payload would possibly still contain null,
but it should be ignored as it is of no use and the signal it self tells the actual
error.
